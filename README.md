## MLT: 
MLT provides a number of scripts, written in python, utilizing high level application programming interfaces such as keras, tensorflow, and caffe to classify and segment both 2D and 3D medical images. The goal of this project is to provide relatively simple deep learning scripts to medical professionals, specifically radiologists, and researchers working in medical imaging. 

## Description:
Our department has a number of projects aimed at exploring the uses of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging. This repository holds all the AI scripts we have developed alongside documentation to help those new to AI explore its use in medical imaging to improve healthcare. 

## Table of Contents: 
The tools and paths to scripts are formatted by the following: 

### _Images_2D_
* Classification
  * Binary Outcome
    * dfdaf
  * Multi-class outcome
* Segmentation (Based on U-net)
  * Binary Mask 
  * Multi-class mask
### _Images_3D_
