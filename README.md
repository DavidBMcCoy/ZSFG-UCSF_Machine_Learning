MLT provides a number of scripts, written in python, utilizing high level application programming interfaces such as keras, tensorflow, and caffe to classify and segment both 2D and 3D medical images. The goal of this project is to provide relatively simple deep learning scripts to medical professionals, specifically radiologists, and researchers working in medical imaging.
